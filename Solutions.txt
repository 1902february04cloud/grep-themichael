#1) grep -i '^Z' cities.txt
--comments: This prints all the cities that start with the letter z. I ignored the case of
'z' just incase the city wasn't capitalized.

#2) grep -i 'gan\>' cities.txt
--comments: This prints out the cities with cities ending in the word 'gan'. I used -i for
the same reason as problem 1.

#3) grep -i '^[ADE]' cities.txt 
    grep -ic '^[ADE]' cities.txt 
--comments: The first line outputs the all the cities that start with an A, D or E using
the [ABC] command. The second line checks to make sure there are 53 output by adding the
-c flag.

#4) grep -i '\<.ar' cities.txt
    grep -ic '\<.ar' cities.txt
    
--comments: The first line uses '.' to ignore the first char and the output prints out all
the cities where the second and third letter are 'a' and 'r'. It checks all the words in
the line with the \< command. The second line checks if there are 22 outputs.

#5) grep -ivc '^c' cities.txt
    
--comments: I use the -v flag to uses the not grep. This gets everything that doesnt
start with 'c'.

#6)
